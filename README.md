#What is the bottom up war strategy?

The bottom-up strategy aims to guarantee as many three star scores as possible. The easiest way to explain this is to use a 10 vs. 10 scenario where a specific order of attacking applies:


###Our #10 attacks #10 opponent
* Was it three starred?
* Yes: Go to step 2
* No: Our #9 attacks #10 again (repeat until three starred)

###Next player up on map attacks #9 opponent
* Was it three starred?
* Yes: Go to step 3
* No: Next player up on map attacks #9 again (repeat until three starred)

Continue the same process as you move up the opponent’s map.

This strategy means that stronger players MUST wait for the lower players to attack – they have priority.
It also means greater participation by all players, and no wasted attacks where a strong player has chosen an enemy who is either too strong or too weak for them.
This strategy works like a pecking order where you are given the best opportunity earn maximised loot. And it doesn’t matter if you don’t three star a base. The next player(s) after you will.

There are several things the clan takes into consideration when using this strategy:

* The bottom player(s) may not be ready or online to make their attack at the beginning of war.
SOLUTION: Let the next player up on map go next.
* What if we’ve used up three attacks on an opponent and it’s still not three-starred?
SOLUTION: Move up to the next opponent (max three attempts on any one opponent).
* A player has attacked too early or didn’t attack in the correct order.
SOLUTION: Players like this need to be properly briefed on the strategy. Kick where repeat offenses occurs.
